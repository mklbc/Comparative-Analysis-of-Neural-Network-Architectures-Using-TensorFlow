# Comparative-Analysis-of-Neural-Network-Architectures-Using-TensorFlow

 Introduction

This project aims to compare the performance of different neural network architectures and configurations using the TensorFlow library. The architectures include feedforward, cascade, and Elman networks. Different numbers of layers will be tried for each architecture, and the 
results will be compared.
